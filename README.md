# Quantium-Virtual-Project
## Introduction
Quantium is a leading data science and AI firm, founded in Australia in 2002. Quantium combines the best of human and artificial intelligence to power possibilities for individuals, organisations and society.

As a part of Quantium's retail analytics team and have been approached by the client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region. Furthermore, the manager also asked us to test the impact of the new trial layouts with a data-driven recommendation as to whether or not the trial layout should be rolled out to all their stores.

All the given information is from the **Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Project** on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/NkaC7knWtjSbi6aYv/Data%20Analytics%20Virtual%20Experience%20Program?ref=H9ARjfcciFq8iXfBx).
