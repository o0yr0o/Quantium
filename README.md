# Quantium-Virtual-Project
## Introduction
Quantium is a leading data science and AI firm, founded in Australia in 2002. Quantium combines the best of human and artificial intelligence to power possibilities for individuals, organisations and society.

As a part of Quantium's retail analytics team and have been approached by the client, the Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region. Furthermore, the manager also asked us to test the impact of the new trial layouts with a data-driven recommendation as to whether or not the trial layout should be rolled out to all their stores.

All the given information is from the **Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Project** on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/NkaC7knWtjSbi6aYv/Data%20Analytics%20Virtual%20Experience%20Program?ref=H9ARjfcciFq8iXfBx).

## Data Preparation and Customer Analytics


## Experimentation and Uplift Testing
Our client has asked us to evaluate the performance of a store trial which was performed in stores 77, 86 and 88.

### Compare the Performance
First, we need to select control stores based on correlations, and then compare the total sales and number of customers between the trial and control stores.

- Trial store 77 and Control store 233 have the most correlation:

- Trial store 88 and Control store 178: 
  - Store 88 and 178 have similar trends among sales and number of customers, however, control store 178 has lower sales and fewer customers than store 88.
